# mkpkgbuild
mkpkgbuild is an interactive utility to create PKGBUILDs. It contains templates
for PKGBUILD and $pkgname.install files that the values entered by the user are
inserted into. If an existing PKGBUILD is found at ./pkgname/PKGBUILD, it will
be parsed and the relevant values will be displayed and sometimes provided as
default values.

Currently all packages are assumed to be "imported" from Hackage, and the
relevant webpage for each package will be scraped to find out the latest
available version, license and dependencies.

PyPI and plain (no import) package creation are planned features.

## Usage
Run mkpkgbuild.py in the package repository root in order for it to find
already existing PKGBUILDs to read from.
